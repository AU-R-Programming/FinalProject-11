##        - Confidence intervals: the user must be able to choose the significance level α to obtain for the 1−α confidence intervals for β and whether to use the asymptotic or bootstrap approach for this.
##        - Plots (with e.g. ggplot2) including:
##             Residuals vs fitted-values (fitted values are ŷ =Xβ̂ ).
##             qq-plot of residuals
##             Histogram (or density) of residuals
##        - Mean Square Prediction Error (MSPE)
##        - F-test: compute the statistic in matrix form and output the corresponding p-value. SSM, SSE, F∗. P(F>F∗) (p-value).
